# Cash-Flow-Minimizer-Web-Application

This is Data Structure & Algorithm Based Model Project. Which Minimizes the Cash Flow Between Set of friends using Greedy Algorithm technique . Here we integrated model with by considering 3 persons involving in the transaction.



This Project is Built with python-cgi, which runs on xampp Apache server. To run python script on xampp server you have to customize xampp by following the steps in given Link.

## Interface:-

Here user has to input amount of transaction happend between Person(X) to Person(Y) in matrix form. Here X:- Row wise ; Y:-Column Wise.






## Here is an example:-

Here "NA" Denotes Not Applicable which is read-only-field . For eg:- Transaction between person1 to person1 not applicable or invalid. 



## Result:-

## Future Enchancement:-
Here we built a static model. You can modify it by dynamically seeking no. of persons involved in the transaction and according input fields.
